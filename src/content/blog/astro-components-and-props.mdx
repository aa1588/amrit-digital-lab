Now that you understand the basics of Astro, let's explore how to create reusable components and work with props.

## Creating Components

Astro components are the building blocks of your application. They're similar to components in other frameworks but with some unique features.

```astro
---
// Component script (runs at build time)
const greeting = "Hello";
---

<div class="card">
  <h2>{greeting} from Astro!</h2>
</div>

<style>
  .card {
    padding: 1rem;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
  }
</style>
```

## Working with Props

Props allow you to pass data to components:

```astro
---
interface Props {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}

const { title, description = 'Default description' } = Astro.props;
---

<article>
  <h2>{title}</h2>
  {description && <p>{description}</p>}
</article>
```

## Component Composition

Build complex UIs by composing smaller components:

```astro
---
import Card from './Card.astro';
import Button from './Button.astro';
---

<Card title="My Card">
  <p>Some content here</p>
  <Button text="Click me" />
</Card>
```

## Slots

Slots let you pass content to components:

```astro
---
// Layout.astro
---
<div class="layout">
  <header>
    <slot name="header" />
  </header>
  <main>
    <slot />
  </main>
</div>
```

## Conclusion

Components and props are fundamental to building maintainable Astro applications. Practice creating reusable components to improve your workflow.
