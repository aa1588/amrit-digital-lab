## The OAuth 2.0

Security is a complex topic. **OAuth 2.0** is no different. Even though frameworks like **Spring Security** help to reduce the complexity, there's still a steep curve to understand how to properly implement security.

In this series, I will share my understanding of **OAuth 2.0** and how we can implement security for a simple microservices based application using **Spring Security OAuth2**.

<Alert type="info">
**Full disclosure:** I'm not a security expert. I'm just documenting what I've learned along the way. If you spot something off, please let me know in the comments!
</Alert>

Before jumping into the implementation, we will start with the concepts.

## What is OAuth 2.0?

**OAuth 2.0** stands for **Open Authorization**.

It is a system that allows one app to safely access another app on behalf of a user.

With OAuth 2.0, you (the user) can let an app use your data from another service **without sharing your password**.

You simply give permission, and the app can only access the things you allow.

`OAuth 2.0` replaced the older `OAuth 1.0` and is now the most widely used way for apps to share data securely.

## Authentication vs Authorization

First off, let's understand two basic security concepts: **Authentication** & **Authorization**

### Authentication

**Authentication** = It checks **who you are** or are you the right person? (confirms your identity)

### Authorization

**Authorization** = It checks **what you are allowed to do** after you are authenticated?

### In Simple Words

- **Authentication** = Who are you?
- **Authorization** = What can you do?

<Alert type="warning">
**Important**: OAuth 2.0 only deals with **Authorization** but **not Authentication**. 

OAuth does not tell who the user is. **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** specification is created to address Authentication which is built as a layer on top of OAuth 2.0.

There are many Identity Provider solutions like **Keycloak**, **Okta**, **Auth0**, etc.

## OAuth 2.0 Components

To quickly summarize, in an OAuth 2.0 system there are various components that play different roles and there are different approaches to authenticate a user.

### OAuth 2.0 Roles

- **Resource Owner**: The resource owner is typically the end user, who authorizes an application (Client) to access his/her account.

- **Resource Server**: Server hosting the protected resources. This is the API you want to access.

- **Client**: An application (which Resource Owner is using) requesting access to a protected resource on behalf of the Resource Owner.

- **Authorization Server**: Server that authenticates the Resource Owner and issues access tokens after successful authorization.

### OAuth 2.0 Grant Types

OAuth 2.0 supports several grant types (flows) for different use cases:

- **Authorization Code Flow**
- **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**
- **Client Credentials Flow**
- **Implicit Flow** (not recommended)
- **Resource Owner Password Flow** (not recommended)

We'll explore these in detail in upcoming parts of this series.

## Understanding OAuth 2.0 with a Real Example

Let's understand this with a practical example that you might encounter in real life.

![OAuth 2.0 Example](/blog-images/oauth2/OAuth2-example.png)

### The Scenario

Imagine you want to use **SnapPrint** (a photo editing app) to edit your photos that are stored on **PhotoStorageCloud** (a cloud storage service).

Let's break down how OAuth 2.0 makes this possible securely:

---

### 1. The User Wants SnapPrint to Access Their Photos

The **Resource Owner** (the end user) attempts to use the SnapPrint app to edit or print photos.

But their photos are not stored inside SnapPrint — they live on **PhotoStorageCloud**, a completely different company with its own protected API.

SnapPrint cannot access any of those private photos directly.

---

### 2. Photos Are Protected - SnapPrint Needs an Access Token

PhotoStorageCloud exposes its API only to clients who present a valid **access_token**.

This access_token proves that:
- The user has authenticated
- The user gave SnapPrint permission to access their photos

Without this token, PhotoStorageCloud will reject all requests.

---

### 3. SnapPrint Delegates Authentication to AuthProviderX

Instead of building its own login system, SnapPrint delegates everything to an external **Authorization Server** called **AuthProviderX**.

AuthProviderX handles:
- User authentication
- Consent screens
- Issuing access_tokens
- Token security and expiration

**SnapPrint never sees the user's password.**

---

### 4. User Authenticates and Gives Consent

When the user clicks "Import My Photos," SnapPrint redirects them to AuthProviderX's secure OAuth 2.0 login page.

Here the user:
1. Signs in using username/password or social login
2. Sees a consent page asking:  
   **"Allow SnapPrint to access your PhotoStorageCloud photos?"**
3. The user explicitly approves this

---

### 5. AuthProviderX Issues an Access Token

If authentication succeeds and the user consents, AuthProviderX generates a signed **access_token** and sends it back to SnapPrint.

This token represents:
- Who the user is
- Which permissions SnapPrint was granted
- How long the access lasts

SnapPrint stores this token securely.

---

### 6. SnapPrint Uses the Token to Access Photos

SnapPrint now attaches the **access_token** to its API requests:

```http
GET /user/photos
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

PhotoStorageCloud verifies the token's signature and permissions.

If the token is valid, the server returns only the photos the user allowed SnapPrint to access.

SnapPrint can now import, display, and edit the photos **without ever knowing the user's credentials**.

---

## The Beauty of OAuth 2.0: Secure, Limited, Revocable Access

With OAuth 2.0:

- **SnapPrint never touches the user's password**
- **The user grants limited access** (photos only, not account settings)
- **The user can revoke access anytime** from AuthProviderX
- **PhotoStorageCloud trusts the access_token**, not SnapPrint directly

This is the power of OAuth 2.0 — secure delegation of access without sharing credentials.

## What's Next?

In this introduction, we've covered the **what** and **why** of OAuth 2.0. We've seen how it separates authentication from authorization and how it enables secure, limited access to resources.

In **Part 2** of this series, we'll dive deeper into:

- **OAuth 2.0 Grant Types** in detail
- **Authorization Code Flow** step-by-step
- **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** and why it matters
- When to use which grant type

---

## Key Takeaways

- OAuth 2.0 is about **Authorization**, not Authentication
- It allows apps to access resources **without sharing passwords**
- Four main roles: Resource Owner, Client, Authorization Server, Resource Server
- Access tokens are the key to secure resource access
- Users maintain control and can revoke access anytime
